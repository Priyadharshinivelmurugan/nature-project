    <p><h3>Petra is approximately at 3-5 hours to the south of modern Amman, approximately 2 hours to the north of Aqaba, on the edges
        of the mountain desert of the Wadi Araba. The city is surrounded by the highest hills of rust by colored sandstone that gives 
        a natural protection to the city against the invaders.Petra has more than 800 individual monuments, including buildings, tombs,
        baths, funeral corridors, temples, arched income, and adjacent streets, which especially were carved in the kaleidoscopic
        sandstone by the technical and artistic genius of their inhabitants. Petra's monuments are best seen by the visitors at 
        early hours of the morning and last hour of the evening, when the Sun warms the multicoloured stones.The site is semi arid, 
        the friable sandstone which allowed the Nabataeans to carve their temples and tombs into the rock crumbling easily to sand. 
        The colour of the rock ranges from pale yellow or white through rich reds to the darker brown of more resistant rocks. 
        The contorted strata of different-coloured rock form whorls and waves of colour in the rock face, which the Nabataeans exploited 
        in their architecture.
