    <p><h3>The Great Wall of China is a series of stone and earthen fortifications in China, built, rebuilt, and maintained between 
    the 5th century BC and the 16th century to protect the northern borders of the Chinese Empire during the rule of successive 
    dynasties.The steps that form the Great Wall of China are very steep and tall in some areas. 
    Tourists often become exhausted climbing the wall and walk no more than a kilometre or two (around a mile). 
    In some areas the blocks were cemented with a mixture of glutinous rice and egg white. 
    In the extreme western desert locations, where good materials are scarce, the wall was constructed from dirt rammed between rough wood tied together with woven mats.
    The Wall is included in lists of the "Seven Medieval Wonders of the World" and also the New Seven Wonders.
     However, it was of course not one of the classical Seven Wonders of the World as recognized by the ancient Greeks.
    It is the world's longest human made structure, stretching over approximately 6,400 km from Shanhaiguan in the east to Lop Nur in 
    the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of Inner Mongolia, but stretches to over 6,700 km in total.
     It is also the largest human made structure ever built in terms of surface area and mass.</h3></p>
