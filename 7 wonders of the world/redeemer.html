    <p><h3>The statue of Christ the Redeemer is located at the top of Corcovado Mountain. 
    The entire monument of statue of Christ the Redeemer is 38m high with the statue accounting for 30m and overlooking the city 
    of Rio de Janeiro is one of the tallest statues in the world; the span from finger tip to fingertip is 28m and there is a small
     chapel housed in the base.The reason why it was built was to show that Christ loves all. 
     In Portuguese, this iconic monument is known as Cristo Redentor. 
     Christ the Redeemer was designed by a French sculptor by the name of Paul Landowski and a local engineer named Heitor da Silva
    Costa was chosen to supervise the entire construction. The statue was built not out of steel but from reinforced concrete as that
     was considered a more suitable material for the cross shaped statue. The external caps of the idol were constructed in soapstone 
     due to the resistance of this material to the extreme time and also due to its malleability.
