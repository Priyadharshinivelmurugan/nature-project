    <p><h3>Rome was a center of learning, trade and commerce for ages and has contributed significantly in the development of these areas. 
        The origination of the word “Coliseum”, probably come from colossal statue of Nero which once stood near the stadium.Originally 
        was the Flavian Amphitheatre, an elliptical amphitheatre located in the heart of the city of Rome.
         It is one of the greatest works of Roman architecture and Roman engineering. The building was constructed by emperors of the 
         Flavian dynasty, hence its original name. In antiquity, Romans may have referred to the Colosseum by the unofficial name 
         Amphitheatrum Caesareum; this name could have been strictly poetic.The Colosseum or Coliseum occupies a site just east of the Roman Forum,
          its construction started between 70 and 72 AD under the emperor Vespasian, opened by Emperor Titus in 80 AD with 100 days of games which roughly have taken th
          e lives of some nine thousand animals and remodeled by Domitian who constructed the hypogeum, a series of underground tunnels used to house animals and slaves. 
         Also added a gallery to the top Colosseum to increase its seating capacity.</h3></p>
